I"c<p>I made the stupid mistake of importing an Eclipse project into my
workspace when the <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=279781">import location was from the workspace
itself</a>. I went to
delete the recursive folder when I encountered an error that the file
path name was too long to delete.<br />
<br />
The <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/236533/how-do-you-automate-copying-file-with-path-too-deep-issues-in-windows">best manual
solution</a>
that I found was to go as deep as possible in the recursive folder and
then map it to a virtual drive.<br />

[subst x: c:\recursiveFolder\]{.Apple-style-span

style=”font-family: ‘Courier New’, Courier, monospace;”}[recursiveFolder\...]{.Apple-style-span
style=”font-family: ‘Courier New’, Courier, monospace;”}<br />

[This can be quite an arduous process; I found myself creating up to 9
virtual drives. It eventually worked though and I was able to delete the
recursive folder.]{.Apple-style-span style=”font-family: inherit;”}<br />

[I also <a href="http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Recursive_Directory_Bug_in_Eclipse_Project_Import">found a
site</a>
with a Perl script that deletes long file paths but haven't tested it
myself.]{.Apple-style-span style=”font-family: inherit;”}</p>
