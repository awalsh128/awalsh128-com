I"¸<p>I have been working on implementing a stream reader for <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/teds.pdf">IEEE 1451.4
TEDS</a> and came
across this interesting
<a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/96/HPL-96-61.pdf">paper</a> regarding
representation of scientific units in code. It provides solutions to
determining unit equivalency (eg.Â V/(mâ€¢kg/sÂ²) = m/(sâ€¢A)). Also
discovered some indivisible base units that can represent any unit (amp,
candela, kelvin, gram, meter, mole, radian, second). With a bit to
represent the placement (high for numerator, low for denominator) and a
bit forÂ presence, a unit storage typeÂ can be derived that only occupies
2 bytes.</p>
