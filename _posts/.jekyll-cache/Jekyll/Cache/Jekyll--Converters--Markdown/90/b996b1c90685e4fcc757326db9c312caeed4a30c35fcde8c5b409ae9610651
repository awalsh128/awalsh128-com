<p>I initially was going to put this together as a single post but quickly
realized that it would be a bit much to try and put all of the
information into one post. To make it more digestable, I decided to
break it up into separate parts. This is by no means a comprehensive
study of lambda calculus or type theory, but rather a quick introductory
series so you can can get started. My goal is that, by the end, you will
be able to understand enough to start reading papers on your own and
have some cursory knowledge of type systems. Also, I am targeting
programmers that want to get a better understanding of the theory behind
type systems in compiler design. If you are comfortable programming in
functional languages, then you will start to see many parallels quickly.
Although, I will give examples using an imperative approach to cover
programmers who may not immediately appreciate these parallels.</p>

<h3 id="mathematical-formalisms">Mathematical Formalisms</h3>

<p>The mathematical underpinnings for describing computability is mostly
famously attributed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del">Kurt
G√∂del</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan
Turing</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church">Alonzo
Church</a>. Church and Turing
took different routes to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis">the same ending
conclusion</a>
(ie. <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-machine/">universal Turing
machine</a>,
<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lambda-calculus/"><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline%20\lambda" alt="" />-calculus</a>).
What is now known as the <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/church-turing/">Church-Turing
thesis</a>. In this post
we will focus strictly on Church's work, more specifically his
notation. By understanding the lambda calculus syntax, we will start to
grasp an idealized model of a programming language and what it means
later for learning type systems.</p>

<h3 id="notation--basic-structure">Notation &amp; Basic Structure</h3>

<p>Let's look at a function that returns the square of its input:</p>

<p>::: {align=‚Äùcenter‚Äù}
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f(x)%20=%20x%5E2" alt="" title="Squared Function" />
:::</p>

<p>::: {align=‚Äùcenter‚Äù}
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int f(int x) { return x * x; }</code>
:::</p>

<p>In lambda calculus, we can represent it as:</p>

<p>::: {align=‚Äùcenter‚Äù}
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\lambda%20x.*x\;x" alt="" title="Squared Function" />
:::</p>

<p>Let's break this down into its parts and start defining those pieces.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Term</strong>: Since x is a variable, it can be considered a term and the
whole expression itself is also a term (specifically a lambda
abstraction).</li>
  <li><strong>Bound Variable</strong>: Any variable in the term that is a parameter of
the function. In this case it is x.</li>
  <li><strong>Free Variable</strong>: The term above has none since any argument to the
term would be applied to all variables in it. If the term were to be
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline%20\lambda%20x.*x\;y" alt="" />
instead, then y would be our free variable. We will give another
example that demonstrates free variables later.</li>
  <li><strong>Abstraction Symbol</strong>: The
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline%20\lambda" alt="" /> symbol
indicates the beginning of the function, followed by the parameter.</li>
  <li><strong>Function Body</strong>: Everything following the dot is part of the
function body (ie.
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline%20*\;x\;x" alt="" />).</li>
</ul>

<p>\</p>

<h3 id="binding--applying-terms">Binding &amp; Applying Terms</h3>

<p>Now the switch from our named function (f) to the lambda term was not
entirely without loss. The
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline%20\lambda" alt="" /> symbol is not
the function name but rather indicates that the following symbol (x) is
a function parameter, just like the period represents the beginning of
the function body. This is where the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function">anonymous
function</a> comes from.
We took a named function (f) and anonymized it. Now let's try defining
the function without loss of information.</p>

<p>::: {align=‚Äùcenter‚Äù}
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f%20\equiv%20\lambda%20x.*x\;x" alt="" title="Squared Function" />
:::</p>

<p>It can sometimes be taken for granted in programming that a function
name is just another type of variable. The above example makes that
pretty clear. Much like a program function name directly references the
code it needs to execute, we bound the function to a variable (f) that
directly references the term. Although the lowercase letter name isn't
considered good convention in lambda calculus. Terms are normally bound
to a capitalized letter in these situations; it would be better form to
call it F instead.</p>

<p>::: {align=‚Äùcenter‚Äù}
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F%20\equiv%20\lambda%20x.*x\;x" alt="" title="Squared Function" />
:::</p>

<p>That's better. What about function pointers? How would they be
expressed in the lambda calculus? Let's define some function pointer
(G), our previous function (F) and bind them in the C language:</p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">G</span><span class="p">)(</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">F</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
   <span class="n">G</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">F</span><span class="p">;</span>
   <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">G</span><span class="p">)(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is generally equivalent to:</p>

<p>::: {align=‚Äùcenter‚Äù}
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?G%20\equiv%20\lambda%20g.g\;\land\;F%20\equiv%20\lambda%20x.*x\;x\;:\;GF2%20=%204" alt="" />
:::</p>

<p>I could have written our <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?GF2" alt="" />
term as <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline%20G(F(2))" alt="" /> but
this is implicit in the lambda calculus. Terms are always <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associativity">applied from
left to right</a>; first F is
applied to G and then 2 is applied to that. Having these semantics
eliminates the need for excessive parentheses. Now let's break down the
application of the terms in steps.</p>

<p>::: {align=‚Äùcenter‚Äù}
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%20\begin%7Balign*%7D%20GF2&amp;\;\;\;\text%7BGiven%7D\\%20\lambda%20g.g(\lambda%20x.*x\;x)2&amp;\;\;\;\text%7BResolve%20F%20and%20G%7D\\%20(\lambda%20x.*x\;x)2&amp;\;\;\;\text%7BApply%20F%20to%20G%7D\\%204&amp;\;\;\;\text%7BApply%202%20to%20GF%7D%20\end%7Balign*%7D" alt="" />
:::</p>

<p>The first line is like the declares in our C program (line 1 and 2). The
second line is akin to when we assign the address of the function F to G
(line 6) and dereference G below it (line 7). The third line is when we
apply the value 2 to the function (line 7).</p>

<h3 id="multiple-parameters">Multiple Parameters</h3>

<p>You may have noticed that all of our terms only accept a single
parameter. This is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">curried
form</a> or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Sch%C3%B6nfinkel">Sch√∂nfinkeled</a>
form if you want to get all crazy about it. You may have heard this
mentioned before when people talk about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)">closures</a>.
Since we can't demonstrate currying in C (nested functions aren't
supported), let's do it in Python:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># uncurried form
</span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">x</span>

<span class="c1"># curried form using named functions
</span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">g</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">h</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">x</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">h</span>

<span class="c1"># curried form using lambda functions
</span><span class="n">h</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">x</span>

<span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">g</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">h</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I took a lot of liberties comparing the lambda terms earlier against the
C program and is why I wrote that they were generally equivalent. You
may have noticed how line 12 looks almost exactly like the actual lambda
calculus notation form of
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline%20\lambda%20x.\lambda%20y.x" alt="" />.
This is why programmers who know functional programming have a much
easier time learning lambda calculus and type systems. In Python, the
<a href="http://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/2009/10/03/static-vs-dynamic-typing-of-programming-languages/">type system is
dynamic</a>
in the sense that a single variable can be rebound to a different type
during its lifetime. Also, lambda functions are explicitly available,
where they were not in C. These kind of features are what differentiates
different languages in terms of expressibility with respect to the
lambda calculus.</p>

<h3 id="beta-reductions">Beta Reductions</h3>

<p>You might not have known it, but by applying different terms, you were
performing what is called a beta-reduction. This is the process of
normalizing to its beta-redex term form. So in the case of FG, the
beta-redex term is
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline%20\lambda%20x.*x\;x" alt="" />.
Let's try something with more terms and reduce it.</p>

<p>::: {align=‚Äùcenter‚Äù}
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%20\begin%7Balign*%7D%20&amp;(\lambda%20w.w)((\lambda%20x.xx)(\lambda%20y.y))\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20w.w)((\lambda%20x.xx)%5Bx%20:=%20\lambda%20y.y%5D)\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20w.w)((\lambda%20y.y)(\lambda%20y.y))\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20w.w)((\lambda%20y.y)%5By%20:=%20\lambda%20y.y%5D)\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20w.w)\lambda%20y.y\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20w.w)%5Bw%20:=%20\lambda%20y.y%5D\\%20&amp;\lambda%20y.y\\%20\end%7Balign*%7D" alt="" />
:::</p>

<p>That normalized nicely. Let's do another one.</p>

<p>::: {align=‚Äùcenter‚Äù}
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%20\begin%7Balign*%7D%20&amp;(\lambda%20x.xx)(\lambda%20y.yy)\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20x.xx)%5Bx%20:=%20\lambda%20y.yy%5D\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20y.yy)(\lambda%20y.yy)\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20y.yy)%5By%20:=%20\lambda%20y.yy%5D\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20y.yy)(\lambda%20y.yy)\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20y.yy)%5By%20:=%20\lambda%20y.yy%5D\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20y.yy)(\lambda%20y.yy)\\%20&amp;\ldots\\%20\end%7Balign*%7D" alt="" />
:::</p>

<p>This is a case where we could keep applying the terms ad-nauseum but
that isn't needed because the repeating term is
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline%20(\lambda%20y.yy)(\lambda%20y.yy)" alt="" />,
which is also our beta-redex term. So there is no need to go any
further. Now let's do another example using free variables.</p>

<p>::: {align=‚Äùcenter‚Äù}
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%20\begin%7Balign*%7D%20&amp;(\lambda%20x.x)(\lambda%20z.zz)(\lambda%20w.t)5\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20x.x)%5Bx%20:=%20\lambda%20z.zz%5D(\lambda%20w.t)5\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20z.zz)(\lambda%20w.t)5\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20z.zz)%5Bz%20:=%20\lambda%20w.t%5D5\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20w.t)(\lambda%20w.t)5\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20w.t)%5Bw%20:=%20\lambda%20w.t%5D5\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20w.t)5\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20w.t)%5Bw%20:=%205%5D\\%20&amp;t%20\end%7Balign*%7D" alt="" />
:::</p>

<p>I mentioned at the beginning I would give an example using free
variables and here it is (ie. t). So what happened to 5? Well it was
bound to w and w is not in the function body of the last lambda term
(<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline%20\lambda%20w.t" alt="" />), so
it didn't survive. Although t did and that is because t is not bound to
anything, thus making it a free variable.</p>

<p>Beta reductions are a lot like refactoring some complex code down to its
simpler and functionally equivalent form.</p>

<h3 id="untyped-lambda-calculus">Untyped Lambda Calculus</h3>

<p>So far we haven't really considered types. In the examples where
multiplication was required, we went beyond the simple untyped system to
demonstrate the similarities of lambda calculus with other more familiar
systems of computation. In the untyped system, the only type is the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_type">function type</a>. Our
previous example could still be considered in the untyped system if we
just interpret 5 as a free variable; attaching no meaning to the
variable itself.</p>

<p>As developers, our building blocks are binary logical operations. Let's
start by defining some of these essentials in the lambda calculus.</p>

<p>Let T be true and F be false:</p>

<p>::: {align=‚Äùcenter‚Äù}
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%20\begin%7Bcenter%7D%20&amp;T%20\equiv%20\lambda%20x.\lambda%20y.x\\%20&amp;F%20\equiv%20\lambda%20x.\lambda%20y.y\\%20\end%7Bcenter%7D" alt="" />
:::</p>

<p>Now let's define some binary operations:</p>

<p>::: {align=‚Äùcenter‚Äù}
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%20\begin%7Balign*%7D%20&amp;AND%20\equiv%20\lambda%20x.\lambda%20y.xyF\\%20&amp;OR%20\equiv%20\lambda%20x.\lambda%20y.xTy\\%20&amp;NOT%20\equiv%20\lambda%20x.xFT\\%20\end%7Balign*%7D" alt="" />
:::</p>

<p>To convince ourselves that these will give the desired results, let's
start with AND:</p>

<p>::: {align=‚Äùcenter‚Äù}
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%20\begin%7Balign*%7D%20&amp;AND\;T\;F\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20x.\lambda%20y.xyF)TF\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20x.\lambda%20y.xyF)%5Bx%20:=%20T%5DF\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20y.TyF)F\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20y.TyF)%5Bx%20:=%20F%5D\\%20&amp;TFF\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20x.\lambda%20y.x)FF\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20x.\lambda%20y.x)%5Bx%20:=%20F%5DF\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20x.\lambda%20y.F)F\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20x.\lambda%20y.F)%5Bx%20:=%20F%5D\\%20&amp;\lambda%20y.F\\%20&amp;F%20\end%7Balign*%7D" alt="" />
:::</p>

<p>Then for good measure, let's do OR as well:</p>

<p>::: {align=‚Äùcenter‚Äù}
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%20\begin%7Balign*%7D%20&amp;OR\;T\;F\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20x.\lambda%20y.xTy)TF\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20x.\lambda%20y.xTy)%5Bx%20:=%20T%5DF\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20x.\lambda%20y.TTy)F\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20x.\lambda%20y.TTy)%5By%20:=%20F%5D\\%20&amp;TTF\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20x.\lambda%20y.x)TF\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20x.\lambda%20y.x)%5Bx%20:=%20T%5DF\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20y.T)F\\%20&amp;(\lambda%20y.T)%5By%20:=%20F%5D\\%20&amp;T\\%20\end%7Balign*%7D" alt="" />
:::</p>

<p>Learning the untyped variant of lambda calculus is a good starting
place, because we don't place any domain restrictions on our functions
and it is fairly simple to get started defining particular behaviors.</p>
