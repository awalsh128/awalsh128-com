<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd468057.aspx">MSDN has a great
article</a> that
explains how to prepare a POCO to be transformed into a proxy. If you
find that an object retrieved or attached to the context does not show
itself in the DynamicProxies namespace (eg. MyNamespace.MyClass instead
of ...DynamicProxies.MyClass), then you probably don't have a
compliant class. You may have noticed this already when hovering your
mouse cursor over an instance and seeing the runtime information on it.<br />
<br />
The distilled points are that your POCO must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be public, not abstract and not sealed;</li>
  <li>have a public or protected parameterless constructor;</li>
  <li>have public overridable properties that are read/write if they are
navigation properties;</li>
  <li>and¬†implement ICollection if they are a one-to-many navigation
property.</li>
</ul>
