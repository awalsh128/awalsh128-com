I"À<p>I setup a server recently using Ubuntu 10.04. LAMP was easy to
configure, as was Subversion. Although making Subversion and Apache2
play nice together with DAV SVN was a nightmare. I followed the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/subversion.html">guide
provided</a>Â but
the website location just kept reprompting for my login.<br />
<br />
After hours of running in circles, I was able to find the solution. The
<em>Require valid-user</em> directive in
/etc/apache2/mods-available/dav_svn.confÂ <a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?p=4413943#post4413943">required the Limit
directive</a>
to be around it.<br />
\</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;Limit GET POST PUT DELETE CONNECT OPTIONS PATCH PROPFIND PROPPATCH
MKCOL COPY MOVE LOCK UNLOCK&gt;<br />
Â  Â Require valid-user<br />
&lt;/Limit&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>LimitExcept</em> directive can also be used as long as the limitations
are specified.</p>
